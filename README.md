# U.S. School Finance Litigation

This repository contains data about all major U.S. school finance litigation from 1971 to present day. The ambition is (a.) aggregate relevant lawsuits and court cases related to reforming a state's school finance system; (b.) link the court cases with available public documents; and (c.) make this data easily digestible through an interactive U.S. map user interface (UI).
